# MultiModuleAndroidApp
A multi-module Android application with resources and UI in two secondary modules

This project builds correctly and the application runs.

However, Android Studio seems to not be able to generate the R class.

This project was created by starting from the "Navigation Drawer Activity" template, and then moving most of the resources to a module and the whole UI to another module.
